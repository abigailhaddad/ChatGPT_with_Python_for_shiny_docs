# Gradio Chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-4 and Langchain, using Shiny for Python Documentation

This Python application provides a chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-4 model through the Langchain library. It utilizes Gradio for the user interface, allowing for interactive conversations. The chatbot uses the documentation for Shiny for Python as its knowledge base.

## How it Works

There are two main scripts in this application: `fetch_shiny_docs.py` and `chatbot.py`.

`fetch_shiny_docs.py` is responsible for pulling down the Shiny for Python documentation from the official GitHub repository. This documentation, stored in `.qmd` files, is cleaned, converted to `.txt` format, and saved into the `data` subfolder in the application's root directory.

`chatbot.py` takes the role of a question-answering bot, utilizing the documentation pulled by `fetch_shiny_docs.py` as its knowledge source. It starts by loading and preparing the textual data, creating embeddings that represent the meaning of the chunks of text from the documents. Using these embeddings, the application can answer questions and carry out a conversation by finding the most relevant chunks to the current query.

## Required Input

Currently, the chatbot is configured to process `.txt` files. If you clone this repository, the required `.txt` files are already present in the `data` folder, generated by the `fetch_shiny_docs.py` script.

If you would like to update the documentation or pull in new changes from the official repository, you can run `fetch_shiny_docs.py` yourself. Additionally, you can modify `fetch_shiny_docs.py` to process other file formats by incorporating the respective document loaders from the Langchain library.

## How to Run

1. Ensure that you have installed all required Python libraries as listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

2. Set up your OpenAI API key. You need to store your API key in a text file located at `../key/key.txt`.

3. Run the `chatbot.py` Python script.

4. Wait for the Gradio interface to launch.

5. Start chatting with the bot!
