         WASHINGTON (AP) — As
         
          former President Donald Trump
         

         prepares for a momentous
         
          court appearance
         

         Tuesday on
         
          charges
         

         related to the
         
          hoarding of top-secret documents
         

         , Republican allies are amplifying, without evidence, claims that he is the target of a
         
          political prosecution.
         


         To press their case, Trump’s backers are citing the
         
          Justice Department’s decision in 2016
         

         not to bring charges against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent in that year’s presidential race, over her handling of classified information. His supporters also are invoking a
         
          separate classified documents investigation concerning President Joe Biden
         

         to allege a two-tier system of justice that is punishing Trump,
         
          the undisputed early front-runner
         

         for the GOP’s 2024 White House nomination, for conduct that Democrats have engaged in.

         “Is there a different standard for a Democratic secretary of state versus a former Republican president?” said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Trump primary rival. “I think there needs to be one standard of justice in this country.”
        



         But those arguments overlook abundant factual and legal differences — chiefly relating to intent, state of mind and deliberate acts of obstruction — that limit the value of any such comparisons.
        

         A look at the Clinton, Biden and Trump investigations and what separates them:
        

         WHAT DID CLINTON DO?
        

         Clinton relied on a private email system for the sake of convenience during her time as the Obama administration’s top diplomat. That decision came back to haunt her when, in 2015,
         
          the intelligence agencies’ internal watchdog
         

         alerted the FBI to the presence of potentially hundreds of emails containing classified information.
        









         FBI investigators would ultimately conclude that Clinton sent and received emails containing classified information on that unclassified system, including information classified at the top-secret level.
        

         Of the
         
          roughly 30,000 emails turned over by Clinton’s representatives,
         

         the FBI has said, 110 emails in 52 email chains were found to have classified information, including some at the top-secret level.
        

         After a roughly yearlong inquiry, the FBI closed out the investigation in July 2016, finding that Clinton did not intend to break the law. The bureau reopened the inquiry months later, 11 days before the presidential election, after discovering a new batch of emails. After reviewing those communications, the FBI again opted against recommending charges.
        

         WHAT IS TRUMP ACCUSED OF DOING?
        


          The indictment
         

         filed by Justice Department
         
          special counsel Jack Smith
         

         alleges that when Trump left the White House after his term ended in January 2021, he took hundreds of classified documents with him to his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago — and then repeatedly impeded efforts by the government he once oversaw to get the records back.
        









         The material that Trump retained, prosecutors say, related to American nuclear programs, weapons and defense capabilities of the United States and foreign countries and potential vulnerabilities to an attack — information that, if exposed, could jeopardize the safety of the military and human sources.
        

         Beyond just the hoarding of documents — in locations including a bathroom, ballroom, shower and his bedroom — the Justice Department says Trump showed highly sensitive material to visitors without security clearances and obstructed the FBI by, among other things, directing a personal aide who was charged alongside him to move boxes around Mar-a-Lago to conceal them from investigators.
        

         Though Trump and his allies have claimed he could do with the documents as he pleased under the Presidential Records Act, the indictment makes short shrift of that argument and does not once reference that statute.
        

         All told, the indictment includes 37 felony counts against Trump, most under an Espionage Act statute pertaining to the willful retention of national defense information.
        

         WHAT SEPARATES THE CLINTON AND TRUMP CASES?
        









         A lot, but two important differences are in willfulness and obstruction.
        

         In an otherwise harshly critical assessment in which he condemned Clinton’s email practices as “extremely careless,” then-FBI Director James Comey announced that investigators had found no clear evidence that Clinton or her aides had intended to break laws governing classified information.
        



         As a result, he said, “no reasonable prosecutor” would move forward with a case. The relevant Espionage Act cases brought by the Justice Department over the past century, Comey said, all involved factors including efforts to obstruct justice, willful mishandling of classified documents and indications of disloyalty to the U.S. None of those factors existed in the Clinton investigation, he said.
        

         That’s in contrast to the allegations against Trump, who prosecutors say was involved in the packing of boxes to go to Mar-a-Lago and then actively took steps to conceal classified documents from investigators.
        

         The indictment accuses him, for instance, of suggesting that a lawyer hide documents demanded by a Justice Department subpoena or falsely represent that all requested records had been turned over, even though more than 100 remained in the house.
        

         The indictment repeatedly cites Trump’s own words against him to make the case that he understood what he was doing and what the law did and did not permit him to do. It describes a July 2021 meeting at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, which he showed off a Pentagon “plan of attack” to people without security clearances to view the material and proclaimed that “as president, I could have declassified it.”
        

         “Now I can’t, you know, but this is still a secret,” the indictment quotes him as saying.
        









         That conversation, captured by an audio recording, is likely to be a powerful piece of evidence to the extent that it undercuts Trump’s oft-repeated claims that he had declassified the documents he brought with him to Mar-a-Lago.
        

         WHERE DOES BIDEN FIT IN?
        

         The White House
         
          disclosed in January
         

         that, two months earlier, a lawyer for Biden had located what it said was a “small number” of classified documents from his time as vice president during a search of the Washington office space of Biden’s former institute. The documents were turned over to the Justice Department.
        

         Lawyers for Biden subsequently
         
          located an additional batch of classified documents at Biden’s home
         

         in Wilmington, Delaware, and the FBI
         
          found even more
         

         during a voluntary search of the property.
        

         The revelations were a humbling setback for Biden’s efforts to draw a clear contrast between his handling of sensitive information and Trump’s. Even so, as with Clinton, there are significant differences in the matters.
        

         Though Attorney General Merrick Garland in January named a
         
          second special counsel to investigate the Biden documents,
         

         no charges have been brought and, so far at least, no evidence has emerged to suggest that anyone intentionally moved classified documents or tried to impede the FBI from recovering them.
        

         While the FBI obtained a search warrant last August to recover additional classified documents, each of the Biden searches has been done voluntarily with his team’s consent.
        

         The Justice Department, meanwhile,
         
          notified Trump’s vice president, Mike Pence, earlier this month
         

         that it would not bring charges after the discovery of classified documents in his Indiana home. That case also involved no allegations of willful retention or obstruction.

That decision came back to haunt her when, in 2015, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/e933681a926d421db18ccc0551018e22\">the intelligence agencies' internal watchdog\u003c/a> alerted the FBI to the presence of potentially hundreds of emails containing classified information.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>FBI investigators would ultimately conclude that Clinton sent and received emails containing classified information on that unclassified system, including information classified at the top-secret level. \u003c/p>\u003cp>Of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-b-comey-on-the-investigation-of-secretary-hillary-clinton2019s-use-of-a-personal-e-mail-system\">roughly 30,000 emails turned over by Clinton's representatives,\u003c/a> the FBI has said, 110 emails in 52 email chains were found to have classified information, including some at the top-secret level.\u003c/p>\u003cp>After a roughly yearlong inquiry, the FBI closed out the investigation in July 2016, finding that Clinton did not intend to break the law. The bureau reopened the inquiry months later, 11 days before the presidential election, after discovering a new batch of emails. After reviewing those communications, the FBI again opted against recommending charges.\u003c/p>\u003ch2>WHAT IS TRUMP ACCUSED OF DOING?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-indictment-documents-922839660373\">The indictment\u003c/a> filed by Justice Department \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jack-smith-special-counsel-prosecutor-donald-trump-garland-e1fdb71cfc258bc2be48a8b890a9269b\">special counsel Jack Smith\u003c/a> alleges that when Trump left the White House after his term ended in January 2021, he took hundreds of classified documents with him to his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago — and then repeatedly impeded efforts by the government he once oversaw to get the records back.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>The material that Trump retained, prosecutors say, related to American nuclear programs, weapons and defense capabilities of the United States and foreign countries and potential vulnerabilities to an attack — information that, if exposed, could jeopardize the safety of the military and human sources.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Beyond just the hoarding of documents — in locations including a bathroom, ballroom, shower and his bedroom — the Justice Department says Trump showed highly sensitive material to visitors without security clearances and obstructed the FBI by, among other things, directing a personal aide who was charged alongside him to move boxes around Mar-a-Lago to conceal them from investigators.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Though Trump and his allies have claimed he could do with the documents as he pleased under the Presidential Records Act, the indictment makes short shrift of that argument and does not once reference that statute.\u003c/p>\u003cp>All told, the indictment includes 37 felony counts against Trump, most under an Espionage Act statute pertaining to the willful retention of national defense information.\u003c/p>\u003ch2>WHAT SEPARATES THE CLINTON AND TRUMP CASES?\u003c/h2>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>A lot, but two important differences are in willfulness and obstruction.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In an otherwise harshly critical assessment in which he condemned Clinton's email practices as “extremely careless,” then-FBI Director James Comey announced that investigators had found no clear evidence that Clinton or her aides had intended to break laws governing classified information. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"b7b1eabadaa04682a566c63a01060c97\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>As a result, he said, “no reasonable prosecutor\" would move forward with a case. The relevant Espionage Act cases brought by the Justice Department over the past century, Comey said, all involved factors including efforts to obstruct justice, willful mishandling of classified documents and indications of disloyalty to the U.S. None of those factors existed in the Clinton investigation, he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>That's in contrast to the allegations against Trump, who prosecutors say was involved in the packing of boxes to go to Mar-a-Lago and then actively took steps to conceal classified documents from investigators. \u003c/p>\u003cp>The indictment accuses him, for instance, of suggesting that a lawyer hide documents demanded by a Justice Department subpoena or falsely represent that all requested records had been turned over, even though more than 100 remained in the house.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The indictment repeatedly cites Trump's own words against him to make the case that he understood what he was doing and what the law did and did not permit him to do. It describes a July 2021 meeting at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, which he showed off a Pentagon “plan of attack” to people without security clearances to view the material and proclaimed that “as president, I could have declassified it.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Now I can’t, you know, but this is still a secret,” the indictment quotes him as saying.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>That conversation, captured by an audio recording, is likely to be a powerful piece of evidence to the extent that it undercuts Trump's oft-repeated claims that he had declassified the documents he brought with him to Mar-a-Lago. \u003c/p>\u003ch2>WHERE DOES BIDEN FIT IN?\u003c/h2>\u003cp>The White House \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-united-states-government-812ef44a5333f6d93423a67a683fa024\">disclosed in January\u003c/a> that, two months earlier, a lawyer for Biden had located what it said was a “small number” of classified documents from his time as vice president during a search of the Washington office space of Biden's former institute. The documents were turned over to the Justice Department.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Lawyers for Biden subsequently \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-united-states-government-district-of-columbia-0574fd762159e8cb5f31c85205df3dc0\">located an additional batch of classified documents at Biden's home\u003c/a> in Wilmington, Delaware, and the FBI \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-politics-delaware-0827b59ee141b33af95023377713e075\">found even more\u003c/a> during a voluntary search of the property.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The revelations were a humbling setback for Biden's efforts to draw a clear contrast between his handling of sensitive information and Trump's. Even so, as with Clinton, there are significant differences in the matters.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Though Attorney General Merrick Garland in January named a \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/classified-documents-biden-home-wilmington-33479d12c7cf0a822adb2f44c32b88fd\">second special counsel to investigate the Biden documents,\u003c/a> no charges have been brought and, so far at least, no evidence has emerged to suggest that anyone intentionally moved classified documents or tried to impede the FBI from recovering them. \u003c/p>\u003cp>While the FBI obtained a search warrant last August to recover additional classified documents, each of the Biden searches has been done voluntarily with his team's consent.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The Justice Department, meanwhile, \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mike-pence-classified-documents-doj-criminal-investigation-campaign-trump-af4ff0d829e32bf33a60e7a2197c761b\">notified Trump's vice president, Mike Pence, earlier this month\u003c/a> that it would not bring charges after the discovery of classified documents in his Indiana home.

He was charged alongside valet Walt Nauta, a personal aide whom prosecutors say moved boxes from a storage room to Trump’s residence for him to review and later lied to investigators about the movement. Nauta traveled with Trump on Saturday, appearing by his side at a Georgia Waffle House stop where the former president signed autographs, posed for photos and told supporters, “We did absolutely nothing wrong.”\u003c/p>\u003cdiv id=\"b7b1eabadaa04682a566c63a01060c97\" class=\"media-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Earlier Saturday, Trump was given a hero's welcome at the party convention in Georgia, where he drew loud applause as he slammed the investigation as “a political hit job” and accused his political enemies of launching “one hoax and witch hunt after another” to prevent his reelection.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The ridiculous and baseless indictment by the Biden administration’s weaponized Department of Injustice will go down as among the most horrific abuses of power in the history of our country,\" he said.\u003c/p>\u003cp>He also used his remarks to rail against President Joe Biden and his 2016 Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, accusing them of mishandling classified information and insisting he was treated unfairly because he is a Republican. But Trump overlooked a critical difference: Only he has been accused of intentionally trying to impede investigators by not returning the documents in question.\u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>In the Clinton probe, for instance, FBI investigators concluded that although she was extremely careless in her handling of classified emails on a private server, there was no evidence that she intended to break the law. And though the Biden investigation is still ongoing, no evidence has emerged to suggest that he intentionally held onto the records or even knew that they were there, with his representatives turning over records after they were discovered and voluntarily consenting to FBI searches.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Trump also lingered on Georgia’s role in his 2020 defeat, repeating his lies that he had won the state and defending his efforts to overturn Biden’s victory, which is the subject of another ongoing investigation, this one by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. Willis has suggested that any indictments would likely come in August.\u003c/p>\u003cp>At the heart of the investigation is a recorded phone conversation in which Trump urges Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-georgia-elections-presidential-elections-bc5cc7f3b5506853d39ba51b7231ca55\">“find 11,780 votes”\u003c/a> — just enough to overtake Biden and overturn Trump’s narrow loss in the state. Trump has defended the phone call as “perfect,\" and on Saturday lashed out against both Willis and the special counsel in the Mar-a-Lago case.\u003c/p>\u003cp>But aside from reacting to the news, Trump's remarks in both states largely mirrored his pre-indictment rally speeches, lending a sense of normalcy to a campaign that is well-practiced in responding to crisis.\u003c/p>\u003cp>And despite the latest criminal charges, attendees cheered him on in Georgia and in North Carolina, where he spoke at a state GOP convention dinner Saturday evening.\u003c/p>\u003cp>About 100 supporters, some waving “Witch Hunt” signs, showed up to the Columbus, Georgia, airfield to greet Trump as he arrived. Jan Plemmons, 66, wearing an oversize foam “Make America Great Again” hat, called the federal charges “absolutely ridiculous” and said she was ready to campaign with Trump. To Michael Sellers, 67, it was “criminal what they're doing to him.\"\u003c/p>\u003cp>The indictment arrives as Trump is continuing to dominate the primary race. Among the various investigations Trump has faced, the documents case has long been considered the most perilous legal threat and the one most ripe for prosecution. But Trump’s continued popularity among Republican voters is evident in how gingerly his primary rivals have treated the federal indictment.\u003c/p>\u003cp>\u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/michael-pence\">Mike Pence\u003c/a>, whose appearance in North Carolina marked the first shared venue with his former boss since the ex-vice president \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pence-iowa-launch-2024-republican-presidential-campaign-faa2082d8d3269dc73a28c893188c2ff\">announced his own campaign\u003c/a> this past week, condemned the “politicization” of the Justice Department and urged Attorney General Merrick Garland \"to stop hiding behind the special counsel and stand before the American people” to explain the basis for the federal investigation into Trump.\u003c/p>\u003cp>In an interview with The Associated Press after his speech, Pence said he had read the indictment but repeatedly declined to share his personal reaction to its contents — including the photographs of boxes with classified information stacked in a Mar-a-Lago bathroom and on a ballroom stage — or to criticize Trump.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“The very nature of a grand jury is that there is no defense presented,” Pence said. “That’s why I said today I’m going to urge patience, encourage people to be prayerful for the former president, but also for all those in authority and for the country going forward.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>At the North Carolina GOP gathering Friday night, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Trump's leading GOP rival, didn't mention Trump by name but compared his situation to that of Clinton.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Is there a different standard for a Democratic secretary of state versus a former Republican president?” DeSantis asked. “I think there needs to be one standard of justice in this country. ... At the end of the day, we will once and for all end the weaponization of government under my administration.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Among the declared Republican contenders, only Arkansas Gov.

Nancy Mace of South Carolina told CNN she believes the indictment “handed Donald Trump the nomination” in the 2024 GOP primary.\u003c/p>\u003cp>And as the House panel has ramped up its efforts to defend the former president, the word “weaponization” has taken root among Trump’s Republican allies. Nearly every GOP lawmaker used the term — as did a member of Trump's legal team hours before the charges were unsealed to the public.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“It puts a stamp of reality on something that really is unreal in terms of the weaponization of the Department of Justice,” said James Trusty, one of Trump’s lawyers, on ABC Friday morning. Trump announced later in the day that Trusty was leaving his team.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas tweeted that “the weaponization of our Department of Justice against enemies of the Biden admin. will do enormous damage to the rule of law &amp; have a lasting impact.”\u003c/p>\u003cp>Cruz’s GOP colleagues in the Senate were more muted, with Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and others who have criticized the former president declining to weigh in on the indictment.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the only GOP senator to vote to convict Trump in both of his impeachment trials, was a rare voice of criticism. While Romney stressed that Trump is entitled to presumption of innocence, he said he believes the charges are serious and Trump brought them on himself.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“These allegations are serious and if proven, would be consistent with his other actions offensive to the national interest,” Romney said. \u003c/p>\u003cp>___\u003c/p>\u003cp>This story has been corrected to reflect that Rep.

It also involved moving boxes to hide the secret documents from Trump's lawyer, and suggesting that Trump's lawyer hide or destroy documents that investigators were seeking.\u003c/p>\u003cp>The indictment says that, at Trump's direction, Nauta moved about 64 boxes of documents from a Mar-a-Lago storage room to the former president’s residence in May 2022. He then returned “approximately 30 boxes” to the storage room on June 2 — the same day Trump’s legal team came to examine the boxes and search for classified documents to return to the government, the indictment says. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003cp>Nauta had a brief phone call with Trump before returning those boxes, the indictment says.

He also says that he could have declassified the document if he was still president.\u003c/p>\u003cp>“Now I can't, you know, but this is still a secret,\" he said, according to the indictment. \u003c/p>\u003cp>A few months later, Trump showed a representative of his political action committee a classified map of a foreign country while discussing a military operation in the country that was not going well, the indictment says. Trump acknowledged that he shouldn't be showing the map to the person and told him not to get too close, prosecutors allege. \u003c/p>\u003cdiv class=\"ad-placeholder\">\u003c/div>\u003ch2>WHAT EVIDENCE DO PROSECTORS HAVE? \u003c/h2>\u003cp>In addition to the audio recording, prosecutors also relied upon text messages between Trump employees, photos of boxes of documents stored in various rooms throughout Mar-a-Lago and details about conversations between Trump and his lawyers that were memorialized by one of them. \u003c/p>\u003cp>In one conversation with his lawyers, Trump said: “I don’t want anybody looking through my boxes.” Trump also asked one of his lawyers if it would be better “if we just told them we don’t have anything here,” the indictment says.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Photographs in the indictment show boxes stacked on a stage in a ballroom as well as in a bathroom. Another shows boxes that spilled over in a storage room, including a document marked “SECRET/REL TO USA, FVEY,” which means information releasable only to members of the “Five Eyes” intelligence alliance of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States.\u003c/p>\u003ch2>WHERE WILL THE CASE BE HEARD? \u003c/h2>\u003cp>While Trump's first court appearance on Tuesday is expected to be in front of a magistrate judge in Miami, the case was filed in West Palm Beach — about 70 miles to the north. The case was assigned to \u003ca href=\"https://apnews.com/article/who-is-aileen-cannon-trump-judge-52964c2098546f8ade989b1555e44aae\">Judge Aileen Cannon,\u003c/a> a Trump appointee, who issued rulings favorable to him last year and expressed repeated skepticism of Justice Department positions.\u003c/p>\u003cp>Cannon was broadly criticized last year for granting the Trump legal team’s request for a special master to conduct an independent review of the hundreds of classified documents seized from his Florida property last year. The move, which temporarily halted core aspects of the Justice Department’s investigative work, was overturned months later by a three-judge panel of a federal appeals court. \u003c/p>\u003cp>____\u003c/p>\u003cp>Associated Press reporters Michael R.
