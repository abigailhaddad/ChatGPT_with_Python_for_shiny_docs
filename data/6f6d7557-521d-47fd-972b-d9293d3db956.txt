             Bill Barr rips Trump over defense on secret documents
            

             “Battle plans for an attack on another country or Defense Department documents about our capabilities are in no universe Donald J. Trump’s personal documents,” he said.

            Former Attorney General Bill Barr attacked former President Donald Trump’s rationale when it came to his possession of top-secret material, saying there is no way Trump has a right to retain some of the material alleged to be in his possession.
           

            “Battle plans for an attack on another country or Defense Department documents about our capabilities are in no universe Donald J. Trump’s personal documents. They are the government’s documents,” Barr said on “Fox News Sunday” in discussing last week’s 37-count indictment.
           





            The former president has said repeatedly that he had a right to declassify and retain any documents from his four years in the White House.
           





















            Barr, who served in the Trump administration, said there was a distinction to be made between the president’s personal documents, such as notes taken at a meeting, and “very sensitive” documents “prepared by government agencies for the purpose of government action.” He also said almost anyone else in the country would have returned the documents if asked.
           

            “This particular episode of trying to retrieve those documents, the government acted responsibly,” he said. “And it was Donald J. Trump who acted irresponsibly.”
           

            The former attorney general also distinguished between Trump’s handling of documents and the processes that other former presidents used in handling the turnover of sensitive documents at the end of their terms, saying they had used secure and orderly procedures.
           

            In differentiating this investigation from others that examined Trump’s conduct, Barr said he had defended Trump in the past — including in response to Alvin Bragg’s recent indictment in New York — but this case is different.
           

            “This idea of presenting Trump as a victim here, a victim of a witch hunt, is ridiculous,” Barr said.
           

            “Yes, he’s been a victim in the past. Yes, his adversaries have obsessively pursued him with phony claims. I have been at his side defending against them when he is a victim. But this is much different. He is not a victim here. He was totally wrong that he had the right to have those documents. Those documents are among the most sensitive secrets the country has.”
